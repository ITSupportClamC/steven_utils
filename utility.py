def allEquals(it):

	[Iterable] it => [Bool] whether all elements are equal

	Where "it" is iterable, for example a range object or a map object.

	Note iterable and iterator are different. iterable is a property, meaning
	if an object is iterable, we can use for or map on that object.

	While iterator is an interface, meaning we can apply next() when an object
	is an iterator.

	Not all iterable objects are iterator, say a range() object is not.

	The function returns True if there is zero or only one element in the
	iterable. Otherwise it uses the == operator to tell whether all of them
	are equal.

	The idea of this function comes from here:

	Check if all elements in a list are identical
